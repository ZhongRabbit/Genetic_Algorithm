<h3>Some excellent reads:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>&lt;&lt;On the Origin of Species&gt;&gt; by Charles Darwin. Of course this has to be the 1st book on the list. A remarkably careful thinker w/ extremely insightful and well-articulated ideas.</b></li>
    <li>&lt;&lt;The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal&gt;&gt; by J. Diamond</li>
    <li>&lt;&lt;The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature&gt;&gt; by M. Ridley</li>
    <li>&lt;&lt;Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity&gt;&gt; by J. Holland. A rather old book, but the foundational building blocks haven't changed much since the book was published.</li>
    <li>&lt;&lt;Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine&gt;&gt; by R. Nesse. Evolutionary Medicine. A sobering perspective on modern human life.</li>
    <li>&lt;&lt;Psychology: An Evolutionary Approach&gt;&gt; by S. Gaulin and D. McBurney. More of a textbook.</li>
    <li>&lt;&lt;The Ancestor's Tale&gt;&gt; by R. Dawkin. A remarkable mind. Out of many insightful notes, Dawkin posed the question of "Can evolvability also be evolved? Can organisms evolve in their ability to adapt?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some Cultural Anthropolgy books will provide a social science perspective on how game theories play out in real-life, in different anthropological settings.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>&lt;&lt;The Dobe Ju/'Hoansi (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology)&gt;&gt; by R. Lee. Interspersed w/ interesting anecdotes.</li>
    <li>&lt;&lt;Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge&gt;&gt; by W. Haviland et. al. More of a textbook.</li>
    <li>&lt;&lt;Culture Sketches: Case Studies in Anthropology&gt;&gt; by H. Peters-Golden. Quite unbiased.</li>
</ul>
